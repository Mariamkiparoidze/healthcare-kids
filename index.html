	<p class="intro">Reports and analysis over the past few years show there’s a significant inequity in healthcare among the children under 19 in the U.S. Kids in American Indian communities have been most affected, with around 11% of children living without health insurance in 2021, the latest data by the Annie E. Casey Foundation’ Kids Count Data Center has found.</p>

				<p class="intro">Additionally, Texas, Wyoming, Alaska, Arizona and North Dakota are the five states with the highest number of kids without insurance, according to a recent report by the State Health Access Data Assistance Center at the University of Minnesota (SHADAC).</p>

				<p class="intro">Colin Planalp, the senior research fellow at SHADAC, says, since the 1990’s the U.S. has made progress in reducing the number of kids without health insurance, but there’s still substantial disparity to health care access.</p>
				
				<p class="intro">
					“There’s some evidence that a lot of those disparities in kids coverage rates across the states are associated with policy decisions that states have made,” Planalp said. “As you look at the patterns across the states, you see a lot of overlap with the decisions the states have made about the Affordable Care Act.”

						He also explained there are multiple issues accounting for high uninsurance rates among native communities, including systemic racism and low income for families, prevalent in native communities.
